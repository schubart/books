2010-11-24 (5/5) Neal Stephenson: The Diamond Age

I read this for the second or third time. It's a great book with
interesting characters and memorable scenes. You can loose yourself in
the rich description of its fascinating world. The writing is full of
little hip references and insider jokes, without being annoying. The
"Primer" is what the Apple iPad would have been in the perfect
world. I want one! In the second half and near the end in particular
the book looses a bit of focus and direction, but that's only a minor
gripe and doesn't distract much from the huge enjoyment of reading it.

2010-10-25 (3/5) Greg Egan: Zendegi

Enjoyable enough, but not one if his best books. I did not really see any
connection between the parts about Iranian politics and the SF bits. I
liked the ending, though.
