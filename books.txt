2011-01-15 (3.5/5) Suzanne Collins: The Hunger Games


2011-01-10 (3/5) Justin Halpern: Sh*t My Dad Says

A harmless, quick read. After a few chapters, the pattern is clear and
does not change much throughout the rest of the book: His father is a
gruff man full of profanity but with a heart of gold... Entertaining
enough; it made me laugh out loud once or twice.


2011-01-08 (4/5) Ken Follett: Fall of Giants


2010-12-27 (2/5) Derren Brown: Confessions of a Conjuror

Almost unreadable. It's a long rambling monologue about nothing in
particular. It spends many long pages and footnotes going on about the
joys and challenges of cutting fingernails, picking ones nose,
replacing torn shoe laces, and replacing the garbage bag after taking
out the trash. I'm not making this up! Also about the social anxieties
and perils of getting on and off the elevator, holding doors open for
neighbors and deciding on a meal in a restaurant. I thoroughly enjoyed
his "Tricks of he Mind", but I didn't feel like I learned anything
interesting at all, about ... anything, from this book.


2010-12-17 (2/5) Max Books: The Zombie Survival Guide

Tedious and repetitive. The mock-serious, pedantic guidebook style is
somewhat amusing at first, but after a while just plain pedantic. The
language and editing are a bit sloppy, and I wondered if this book is
even meant to be read cover to cover or whether it's just one of these
novelty books like the "Klingon dictionary" that are good for a chuckle
when given as a present and end up unread on the book shelf after being
flicked through once. The same ideas were presented much better and much
more entertainingly in "World War Z" by the same author.


2010-11-24 (5/5) Neal Stephenson: The Diamond Age

I read this for the second or third time. It's a great book with
interesting characters and memorable scenes. You can loose yourself in
the rich description of its fascinating world. The writing is full of
little hip references and insider jokes, without being annoying. The
"Primer" is what the Apple iPad would have been in the perfect
world. I want one! In the second half and near the end in particular
the book looses a bit of focus and direction, but that's only a minor
gripe and doesn't distract much from the huge enjoyment of reading it.


2010-11-09 (4/5) Max Brooks: World War Z


2010-10-25 (3/5) Greg Egan: Zendegi

Enjoyable enough, but not one if his best books. I did not really see any
connection between the parts about Iranian politics and the SF bits. I
liked the ending, though.
